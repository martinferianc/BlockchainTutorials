## How did it all start?

### Bitcoin

All the hype started with Bitcoin (October 31 2008). Original white paper describing a system to allow peer to peer payments without a financial intermediary (like a bank).

Transaction reversals are cited as an issue with online commerce aka. customer to charge back a purchase.

Only purpose at the time was to enable financial transactions.

### Ethereum

Another whitepaper (2013). This guy thought about bitcoin being too simple, he is talking about ethereum to be a platforim/basis for much more advanced applications. Introduces the ide of _Smart Contract_ as an entity that can send and receive currency beyond just humans.

## What is Ethereum?

We are working with network of computers, which are used to transfer money and store data. There can be different networks

The _blockchain_ is a database that stores a record of every transaction that has ever taken place.

## Interfacing with network

There are frameworks for developers and then just normal consumer clients. Developers:`web3.js`, consumers: _Metamask (Chrome extension), Mist Browser_.

## How transactions work?

### _Transaction_

Haha nonce means nonsense :). What is odd is that the original donor is missing right? That is what _v,r,s_ is for, they are extremly complicated cryptographic properties, which are generated by the sender, that can be then reconstructed to mean who the original _sender_ is.
